## Project Overview


Project Overview
In the "Would You Rather?" Project, you'll build a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In your app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.


## Purpose

This application is built to demonstrate the learned skills in React, Redux, and Javascript. Two of the most important learned skills during the nanodegree are.

1. React
2. Redux
